# MediBot Chat History and EHR System Fixes

## Overview

This document details the fixes implemented to resolve issues with chat history not functioning properly and the EHR system not storing user symptoms correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat History Not Functioning Properly

**Problem**: The chat history was not loading correctly in the frontend, and users could not see their previous conversations.

**Root Cause**: The `get_chat_history` method in `medibot2_auth.py` was incorrectly structured. It was trying to retrieve both user messages and AI responses from single database rows, but the system stores them as separate rows with different `message_type` values.

**Solution**: 
- Rewrote the SQL query to properly JOIN user messages with their corresponding assistant responses
- Used `message_order` to correctly pair user messages with AI responses
- Added fallback handling for cases where responses might be missing

**Files Modified**: 
- `medibot2_auth.py` (lines 538-572)

### 2. EHR System Not Storing Symptoms

**Problem**: User symptoms were not being detected and saved to the EHR system, preventing the medical history from building up.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Conversation ID Issue**: The system was generating new conversation IDs instead of using the session's existing conversation_id
2. **Keyword Extraction Problems**: The symptom keyword extraction was too restrictive and had issues with partial matching
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Limited logging made it difficult to diagnose issues

**Solutions**:

#### A. Fixed Conversation ID Handling
- Modified the symptom saving logic to retrieve `conversation_id` from the user's active session
- Added fallback logic when conversation_id is missing
- Enhanced error logging throughout the process

#### B. Improved Keyword Extraction
- Enhanced the `extract_symptom_keywords` method with a more comprehensive medical keyword list
- Fixed partial matching issues that were causing false positives
- Added support for common symptom phrases like "feel sick", "under the weather"

#### C. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging at each step of the symptom detection process
- Improved error messages for debugging
- Added verification that symptoms are actually saved to the database

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py` (lines 338-378) - Symptom detection and saving logic
- `medibot2_auth.py` (lines 680-714) - Keyword extraction method

## Technical Details

### Chat History Fix

**Before**:
```sql
SELECT message, response, timestamp
FROM chat_history
WHERE user_id = %s AND message_type = 'user'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT %s
```

**After**:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.message as user_message,
    a.message as assistant_response,
    u.timestamp,
    u.conversation_id
FROM chat_history u
LEFT JOIN chat_history a ON (
    u.conversation_id = a.conversation_id 
    AND u.message_order + 1 = a.message_order 
    AND a.message_type = 'assistant'
)
WHERE u.user_id = %s AND u.message_type = 'user'
ORDER BY u.timestamp DESC
LIMIT %s
```

### EHR Symptom Detection Fix

**Enhanced Keyword List**: Added medical terms including:
- Body parts: `chest`, `stomach`, `back`, `neck`, `throat`
- Symptoms: `headache`, `fever`, `cough`, `pain`, `ache`, `dizzy`, `weak`
- Descriptors: `sick`, `ill`, `hurt`, `uncomfortable`, `tender`
- Phrases: `feel sick`, `feel bad`, `not well`, `under weather`

**Improved Detection Logic**:
```python
# Get conversation_id from the user's session data
conversation_id = request.user.get('conversation_id')
if not conversation_id:
    # Fallback: create a conversation ID if none exists
    conversation_id = f"user-{user_id}-{int(time.time())}"
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests Created

1. **Logic Tests** (`/tmp/test_logic_only.py`):
   - Tests symptom detection with various message types
   - Verifies keyword extraction accuracy
   - Tests chat history pairing logic

2. **Database Tests** (`/tmp/test_sqlite_adapter.py`):
   - Tests SQL queries with SQLite adapter
   - Verifies chat history retrieval
   - Tests EHR symptom storage and retrieval

### Test Results
```
‚úÖ All SQLite database tests PASSED
‚úÖ The SQL queries and logic appear to be working correctly
‚úÖ Chat history pairing logic works as expected
‚úÖ EHR symptom storage and retrieval works correctly
```

## How to Verify the Fixes

### 1. Chat History Functionality

1. **Start the application**: `python main.py`
2. **Login** as a user
3. **Send several chat messages** with medical content
4. **Refresh the page** or check the chat history section
5. **Verify**: Previous conversations should now appear in the sidebar
6. **Click on old conversations**: Should load the complete message history

### 2. EHR System Functionality

1. **Send messages with symptoms** like:
   - "I have a headache"
   - "My stomach hurts"
   - "I feel sick and tired"
   - "I'm experiencing chest pain"

2. **Check the EHR modal** (click the medical records icon)
3. **Verify**: Symptoms should appear in the health records with:
   - Extracted keywords
   - Severity levels
   - Timestamps
   - Symptom descriptions

### 3. Backend Logging

Monitor the console output for:
```
üè• Detected potential symptoms in message: I have a headache...
‚úÖ Symptoms saved with ID: 123
üíæ Chat saved to database
```

## Database Schema

The fixes work with the existing schema:

### chat_history table
```sql
- user_id: Links to user
- session_id: Links to session  
- conversation_id: Groups related messages
- message_type: 'user' or 'assistant'
- message: The actual message content
- response: For assistant messages, contains the response
- message_order: Ensures proper pairing
```

### patient_symptoms table
```sql
- user_id: Links to user
- conversation_id: Links to the conversation where symptoms were mentioned
- symptoms_text: Original user message
- keywords: Extracted medical keywords
- severity: Detected severity level
- created_at: Timestamp
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Chat History**: The JOIN query is optimized with proper indexes on `conversation_id`, `message_order`, and `user_id`
- **Symptom Detection**: Keyword extraction runs in-memory and is efficient for typical message lengths
- **Database Calls**: Minimal impact - only one additional query per message when symptoms are detected

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced NLP**: Replace simple keyword matching with more sophisticated medical NLP
2. **Symptom Categorization**: Automatically categorize symptoms by medical specialty
3. **Severity Detection**: Improve severity detection using context and modifiers
4. **Similar Symptoms**: The `find_similar_symptoms` method is already implemented for historical matching

## Troubleshooting

### Chat History Not Loading
1. Check database connection
2. Verify user has active session
3. Check console for database errors
4. Ensure `conversation_id` is being set correctly

### Symptoms Not Being Saved
1. Check that messages contain medical keywords
2. Verify symptom detection logging in console
3. Ensure database has `patient_symptoms` table
4. Check user permissions for database writes

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify MySQL server is running
2. Check environment variables in `.env` file
3. Ensure database user has proper permissions
4. Test connection with: `python medibot2_auth.py`
