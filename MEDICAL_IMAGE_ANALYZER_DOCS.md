## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. MedicalImageAnalyzer Class
```python
from src.ai.medical_image_analyzer import MedicalImageAnalyzer, analyze_medical_image

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = MedicalImageAnalyzer()

# Analyze image
result = analyze_medical_image(image_data, image_type="skin", user_city="Bangalore")
```

#### 2. Specialized Medical Prompts
Each medical category has its own specialized prompt:

- **Dermatology**: Focuses on skin texture, color, patterns, lesions
- **Radiology**: Analyzes bone structure, soft tissues, abnormalities
- **Ophthalmology**: Examines eye structures, pupil response, inflammation
- **Dental**: Assesses tooth condition, gum health, oral hygiene
- **Wound Care**: Evaluates healing stages, infection signs, severity

#### 3. Image Processing
- Supports JPEG, PNG, WEBP formats
- Maximum file size: 20MB
- Automatic image resizing for API efficiency
- Base64 encoding for OpenAI API

## Usage Examples

### 1. Analyze Skin Condition
```python
# Upload skin image
image_data = open('skin_condition.jpg', 'rb').read()
result = analyze_medical_image(image_data, 'skin', 'Bangalore')

if result['success']:
    print(result['analysis']['ai_interpretation'])
    print(f"Recommended specialist: {result['analysis']['specialist_type']}")
```

### 2. Analyze X-ray Image
```python
# Upload X-ray
image_data = open('xray.jpg', 'rb').read()
result = analyze_medical_image(image_data, 'xray', 'Mumbai')

if result['success']:
    analysis = result['analysis']
    print(f"Radiological findings: {analysis['ai_interpretation']}")
    for doctor in analysis['doctors']:
        print(f"Doctor: {doctor['name']} - {doctor['city']}")
```

## Medical Disclaimer and Ethics

### Important Disclaimers
- **Educational Purpose Only**: All analyses are for educational and informational purposes
- **Not a Medical Diagnosis**: Does not replace professional medical evaluation
- **Professional Consultation Required**: Always emphasizes need for qualified healthcare providers
- **No Treatment Advice**: Provides information only, not treatment recommendations

### Ethical Considerations
- Clear disclaimer on every analysis
- Emphasis on professional medical consultation
- Privacy-conscious image handling
- No storage of medical images
- Appropriate urgency indicators

## Performance and Optimization

echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Test API connectivity
python -c "from openai import OpenAI; client = OpenAI(); print('API key valid')"
```

#### 2. Import Errors
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install openai pillow

# Check Python path
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

#### 3. Image Upload Issues
- Check file size (max 20MB)
- Verify supported formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
- Ensure proper form encoding (multipart/form-data)

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Migration from Skin Analyzer

### Backward Compatibility
- Old `/skin-analyzer` route redirects to new analyzer
- Legacy API endpoint `/api/v1/analyze-skin` still works
- Existing links and bookmarks continue to function

### Migration Benefits
1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Real AI analysis vs. mock responses
2. **Broader Coverage**: Multiple medical specialties vs. skin only
3. **Professional Quality**: Medical-grade analysis and recommendations
4. **Better UX**: Modern interface with category selection
5. **Future-Proof**: Built on latest OpenAI technology

The Medical Image Analyzer represents a significant upgrade from the previous skin analyzer, providing professional-grade medical image analysis powered by state-of-the-art AI technology while maintaining ethical standards and user safety.
