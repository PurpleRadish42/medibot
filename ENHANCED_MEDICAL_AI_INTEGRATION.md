- **FastMRI**: Facebook AI's MRI analysis and reconstruction
- **RetinaNet**: Diabetic retinopathy screening and grading

### 🔬 **Advanced Features**

#### Multi-Modal Analysis Pipeline
1. **Image Type Detection**: Automatic routing to appropriate specialist models
2. **VLM Analysis**: Vision-language understanding with medical context
3. **Specialized Model Analysis**: Domain-specific AI (CheXNet, DermNet, etc.)

5. **LLM Enhancement**: Language model symptom analysis
6. **Results Fusion**: Intelligent combination of all analysis methods

#### Model Selection Logic
```python
# Automatic model selection based on image type and symptoms
Image Type: "chest x-ray" + Symptoms: "cough, fever" → CheXNet
Image Type: "skin lesion" + Symptoms: "dark mole" → DermNet  
Image Type: "brain mri" + Symptoms: "headache" → FastMRI
Image Type: "retinal photo" + Symptoms: "blurred vision" → RetinaNet
```
