## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified

#### New Files:
- `email_service.py` - Email service module with SMTP2GO integration

#### Modified Files:
- `main.py` - Added `/api/send-email` API endpoint
- `templates/chat.html` - Added email button, modal, and JavaScript functions
- `.env.example` - Added SMTP configuration variables

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/send-email
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "doctor_html": "<html>...</html>",
  "user_query": "I have chest pain"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Doctor recommendations sent successfully to user@example.com"
}
```

### Frontend Integration
The email button is automatically added to bot messages that contain doctor recommendations. The detection logic looks for:
